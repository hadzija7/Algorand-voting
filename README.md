# Algorand-voting
Voting dapp on the Algorand blockchain

## Introduction
This is the MVP of the voting system built on Algorand blockchain. Users can connect their algo wallet and create new voting polls.
Each poll has a time duration. If the voting ended users cannot vote anymore and the owner can declare the winning voting option.

## Improvements
This is only the demo of the voting system. The final goal is to implement anonymous voting dapp with the use of Zero-Knowledge proofs.
